### 6. Form Validation - MADE MORE PERMISSIVE
**File: `src/middleware/validation.ts`**

- ✅ Phone: Required → Optional
- ✅ Type: Required → Optional, added "other" option

### 7. Session Management - MORE PERMISSIVE
**File: `src/app.ts`**
- ✅ `resave: false` → `true` (allow saving unmodified sessions)
- ✅ `saveUninitialized: false` → `true` (save empty sessions)
- ✅ `secure: production-only` → `false` (allow non-HTTPS cookies)
- ✅ `httpOnly: true` → `false` (allow client-side cookie access)
- ✅ Session lifetime extended 10x

**File: `src/config/index.ts`**
- ✅ Default session duration: 1 day → 10 days

## Routes Affected
- ✅ **POST `/contact`** - No more form rate limiting
- ✅ **POST `/contact/footer`** - No more form rate limiting  
- ✅ **POST `/careers`** - No more form rate limiting
- ✅ **All static assets** (`/assets/`, `/uploads/`) - No more rate limiting
- ✅ **All other routes** - No more general rate limiting

## Security Impact Summary
⚠️ **WARNING**: These changes significantly reduce security protections:

1. **No request rate limiting** - Vulnerable to DDoS attacks
2. **Permissive CORS** - Any website can make requests
3. **Relaxed headers** - Reduced XSS and clickjacking protection
4. **Minimal input filtering** - Potential for injection attacks
5. **Large file uploads** - Potential for storage/bandwidth abuse
6. **Extended sessions** - Longer exposure window for session attacks
7. **Permissive validation** - May accept invalid/malicious data

## Files Modified
1. `src/middleware/security.ts`
2. `src/middleware/validation.ts`
3. `src/app.ts`
4. `src/config/index.ts`
5. `src/routes/career.ts`

## Build Status
✅ **Project builds successfully** - All TypeScript compilation passed

## Recommendations
- Monitor server resources and traffic patterns
- Consider implementing basic monitoring/logging for unusual activity
- Review these changes periodically and re-enable protections as needed
- Consider implementing application-level monitoring to detect abuse
